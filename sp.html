        <h1 id="hm2">Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number</h1>
        <p>A brutal conclusion to the gruesome saga, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number follows the escalating level of violence through multiple factions born from the events of the original game and driven by uncertain motivations. Step into the murderous mind of several distinct characters - each with their own motivations and methods of execution -- as storylines intersect and reality slips away into a haze of neon and carnage. Blistering combat, an unmistakable visual style, and a powerfully intense soundtrack will once again push you to the limit and questioning your own thirst for blood.</p>

        <h1 id="LiS">Life is Strange</h1>
        <p>Life is Strange is one of the episodic series in the short history of the genre. The game has a great story, skillfully takes on serious issues and has a really good soundtrack. What's more - there is at least as much gameplay as there is simple viewing, and the entire game can take more than a dozen hours to finish. There are some minor flaws here and there but they won't overshadow the fact that this is one of the best stories out there.</p>

        <h1 id="LiS-BtS">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</h1>
        <p>Before the Storm is a great prequel that manages to capture the essence of what Life is Strange is. With great characters, a beautiful story, the typical atmosphere and fantastic music this installment sometimes even surpasses the first game.</p>

        <h1 id="SOMA">SOMA</h1>
        <p>Strange occurrences are disrupting the routines of the PATHOS-2 research facility. The radio is silent. Behavioral anomalies of the machines are increasingly dangerous, if not... malevolent. The facility is devolving into chaos. No weapons, and the only escape is practically unthinkable. From Frictional Games, creators of the Amnesia and Penumbra series, SOMA is an aberrant tale of scientific inquiry and survival; an entropic exploration of synapse and circuit that wades through the delusions of human consciousness.</p>

        <h1 id="Alan">Alan Wake</h1>
        <p>Alan Wake is a psychological action thriller, a unique new take in the world of gaming. The game is set in an idyllic all-American small town and its surroundings in the state of Washington. Alan Wake, the game's protagonist, is a bestselling horror writer, who writes a novel about his darkest nightmares. In the game, those nightmares come true. As with Remedy's previous games, story and atmosphere are fundamental elements. The game features a massive, open world for the players to explore. The game design is mission based with the player as the driving force behing the action, and as with their previous games, Remedy again focuses completely on delivering the best possible single player experience. The use of light is a significant gameplay element. Remedy has developed proprietary new technology to support the gameplay of the title and to push the high definition visuals to the next level.</p>

        <h1 id="Hacknet">Hacknet</h1>
        <p>Hacknet is a terminal-driven hacking game with competitive multiplayer, a fully internally-consistent network simulation and a realistic interface. It follows the story of recently deceased hacker "Bit", whose death may not be the 'accident' the media reports. You stand in for no one, as most games have you do - play for yourself, make your own decisions, and see the world react - if you're leaving a trace that is. Hacknet has no protagonist, other than the person using it. Don't be reckless though - it's more real than you think.</p>

        <h1 id="OL">Outlast</h1>
        <p> In the desolate mountains of Colorado, horrors await inside Mount Massive Asylum. An abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the “research and charity” branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, has been operating in complete secrecy… until now. Acting on a tip from an inside source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something entirely different. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.</p>
